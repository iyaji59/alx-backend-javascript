ES6 Promise
An asynchronous operation is a task that doesn't necessarily execute in sequential order with the rest of your code. Instead, it runs "in the background" while the rest of your code continues to execute.
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to handle asynchronous operations more elegantly and avoid the "callback hell"
